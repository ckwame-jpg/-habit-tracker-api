# 🧱 Habit Tracker API

A backend API for tracking daily habits — built with FastAPI, locked in with JWT auth, and wrapped up in Docker so it runs anywhere.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Sign up and log in with secure token-based auth
- Create habits tied to your user account
- Track when you complete them
- See how long you’ve kept a streak alive
- Swagger docs included for easy testing

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – lightweight and fast
- **SQLite** – keeping it simple for now
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM life
- **JWT** – user auth with `python-jose`
- **Docker** – containerized to flex it clean

## 🔐 Auth Flow

1. `POST /register` – create an account  
2. `POST /login` – get your token  
3. Use `Bearer <token>` in Swagger's Authorize button to hit protected routes
